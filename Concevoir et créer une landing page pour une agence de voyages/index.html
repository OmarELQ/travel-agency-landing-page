              Fantastic day hike that worked perfectly from the very start. We
              were collected from a prearranged pick up point near our Riad at
              exactly the scheduled time, excellent drive to Imlil and then
              started our trek from Imlil. Lovely walk through trees lower down,
              more exposed higher up but our guide (Lehkson?) was very
              considerate and helpful. Lovely lunch on the way up, I was too hot
              by the time we reached the col and needed a rest but my husband
              made the summit.

              We did a 4 day, 3 night trek with family and friends in and around
              the Imlil area. Our guide, Ahmed was very friendly and helpful. As
              a Berber local, his knowledge of the area, the Berber people and
              culture was excellent and our treks were interspersed with many
              conversations about their traditions and lifestyle. When he felt
              that our proposed route could be hazardous due to weather
              conditions, he explained his rationale and took us oe.

              Jamal was very quick to respond to any questions when organizing
              the trek which made everything clear and simple. The whole
              experience felt secure with his confident arrangements from hotel
              pick-up to providing a great trek team. Ahmed our guide was very
              friendly and knowledgeable and good company. Mohammed senior our
              cook/muleteer was always smiling and produced great food and his
              assistant Mohammed junior was polite, friendly and very helpful.
